# Detailed Project Report: SVM Implementation for CIFAR-10 Dataset

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for the CIFAR-10 dataset, a standard dataset in machine learning for object recognition.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Data Loading**: The CIFAR-10 dataset is loaded using a custom function `load_CIFAR10`. This dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.
- **Data Preprocessing**: The data is preprocessed by reshaping the image data into rows, normalizing the data by subtracting the mean image, and adding a bias dimension.

## SVM Classifier Implementation
- **Classifier Setup**: An SVM classifier is implemented to classify images into one of the 10 classes.
- **Training**: The SVM is trained on a subset of the CIFAR-10 training data.
- **Validation**: A validation set is used to tune hyperparameters.
- **Testing**: The final model is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its performance.

## Evaluation and Results
- **Performance Metrics**: The accuracy of the model is reported on both the validation and test sets.
- **Analysis**: Insights into the model's performance, including potential areas for improvement, are discussed.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the application of an SVM classifier on the CIFAR-10 dataset, highlighting key steps in machine learning workflows such as data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
